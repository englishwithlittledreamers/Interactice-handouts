                    <div class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                        <p class="mb-3">1 One amazing characteristic of the humpback whale is its ability to sing. A male humpback whale may sing individually, or it may sing in concert with other nearby male humpback whales. One song can last as long as 15 minutes, and it can be made up of as many as seven themes that are used repeatedly throughout the song. The song consists of low moaning sounds, blasts that sound like horns, and high squeals.</p>
                        <p class="mb-3">2 There is a lot that scientists know about the songs of the humpback whale. However, some of the things are not known <strong class="font-bold">with certainty</strong>. <mark>They are how the humpback whales produce their songs, why they are singing the songs, and when and where the humpback whales sing.</mark></p>
                        <p class="mb-3">3 [A] It is unclear how humpback whales are able to produce sounds while they are singing. [B] This is unclear because humpback whales do not have vocal cords. [C] It is also unclear because their mouths are not moving while they are singing. [D]</p>
                        <p class="mb-3">4 Something else that is not clear is the reason why humpback whales sing. When a male humpback whale begins singing, other male humpback whales respond. It is not female whales that respond. <mark>Perhaps the males are joining together to sing because they want female whales that are far away to hear them.</mark></p>
                        <p class="mb-3">5 In addition to not understanding how and why humpback whales sing, scientists also do not understand fully when and where <strong class="font-bold">they</strong> produce their songs. Humpback whales from Alaska travel to Hawaii for the winter months of November through May, and then they return to Alaska. The whales rarely sing when they are in Alaska, but sometimes they do. They sing a lot more and a lot more often when they are in the waters of Hawaii.</p>

                    <div class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                        <p class="mb-3">1 In the summer of 1964, well-known writer and editor Norman Cousins became very ill. His body ached and he felt constantly tired. It was difficult for him to even move around. He consulted his physician, who did many tests. Eventually he was diagnosed as having ankylosing spondylitis, a very serious and destructive form of arthritis. His doctor told him that he would become immobilized and eventually die from the disease. He was told he had only a 1 in 500 chance of survival.</p>
                        <p class="mb-3">2 Despite the diagnosis, Cousins was determined to overcome the disease and survive. <mark>He had always been interested in medicine and had read the book The Stress of Life (1956) by Hans Selye, an organic-chemist, which discussed how body chemistry and health can be damaged by emotional stress and negative attitudes. This made Cousins think about the possible benefits of positive attitudes and emotions.</mark> He thought, “If negative emotions produce (negative) changes in the body, wouldn’t positive emotions produce positive chemical changes? Is it possible that love, hope, faith, laughter, confidence, and the will to live have positive therapeutic value?”</p>
                        <p class="mb-3">3 [A] He decided to concentrate on positive emotions as a remedy to heal some of the symptoms of his ailment. [B] In addition to his conventional medical treatment, he tried to put himself in situations that would <strong class="font-bold">elicit</strong> positive emotions. “Laugh therapy” became part of his treatment. He scheduled time each day for watching comedy films, reading humorous books, and doing other activities that would bring about laughter and positive emotions. [C] Within eight days of starting his “laugh therapy” program, his pain began to decrease and he was able to sleep more easily. His body chemistry even began to change, and doctors were able to see an improvement in his condition! He was able to return to work in a few months’ time and actually reached complete recovery after a few years. [D]</p>
                        <p class="mb-3">4 <strong class="font-bold">Skeptical</strong> readers may question the doctor’s preliminary diagnosis, and argue that Cousins was not really healed because he didn’t have the disease in the first place. However, Cousins believes his recovery is the result of a mysterious mind-body interaction. His “laugh therapy” is a good example of one of the many alternative, or nonconventional, medical treatments people look to today.</p>

                        <p class="mb-3">1 An American TV network has had an international hit with the drama “24,” a thriller known for its suspense and often graphic violence. Over the past year, controversy has surrounded the series because of its portrayal of Muslim terrorists and its frequent scenes of torture. But the content of “24” is not the only thing that would have been unthinkable on prime‑time television 20 years ago. Its form also represents a major change in modern TV: during each episode’s 44 minutes – a real‑time hour, minus 16 minutes for commercials – the show connects the lives of 21 different characters, <strong class="font-bold">each</strong> with their own personalities and specific relationships with other characters. Nine different story lines (or “threads”) are depicted, each involving events and information revealed in previous episodes. [A]</p>
                        <p class="mb-3">2 [B] For years many people have assumed that popular culture is in a state of decline, rapidly degenerating into “<mark>junk culture</mark>” with no worthwhile purpose. But an interesting new book challenges that assumption. Everything Bad Is Good for You: How Today’s Popular Culture Is Actually Making Us Smarter, by Steven Johnson, makes a persuasive argument that today’s complex TV dramas and other pop culture products give us healthy mental exercise. He calls the use of complex, interwoven plot lines involving multiple characters “<strong class="font-bold">multi‑threading</strong>,” and it is a new and growing phenomenon in TV. To keep up with shows like “24,” he points out, you must “pay attention, make inferences, track shifting social relationships,” and these cognitive challenges are changing our mental development for the better. [C]</p>
                        <p class="mb-3">3 [D] The most obvious change in the last five years of narrative entertainment is the rise of reality TV. Surely, you might be thinking, watching “Survivor” or “The Bachelor” cannot possibly raise anyone’s IQ. “Survivor” is now in its tenth season, and “The Bachelor” is in its seventh. But as Johnson tells us, lately “even the junk has improved.” The new reality shows are like games: <strong class="font-bold">they</strong> are series of competitive tests, each more challenging than the last, and with rules that must be learned as you play on. On “Survivor,” for instance, the participants and the audience know the general <strong class="font-bold">objective</strong> of the game, but each episode brings new challenges that require quick thinking. Success in these games calls for the intellectual labor of finding the weak spots in the rules and in your opponents. This labor is done not just by the stars of the shows, but the viewers at home as well. This is what makes these shows such fun to watch – the human mind enjoys being challenged. As Johnson writes, “There’s real pleasure ... in solving puzzles, detecting patterns or understanding a complex narrative system.”</p>

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-indigo-600 mb-4">Piaget’s Theory of Cognitive Development</h3>
                    <div class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                        <p class="mb-3">1 The psychologist, philosopher and scientist Jean Piaget has the distinction of being one of the most influential researchers in developmental psychology. Born in Neuchâtel, Switzerland, Piaget was an independent and precocious child and took such an early interest in nature that he wrote his first paper about an albino sparrow when he was 10. During his late adolescence, he studied mollusks and published 20 papers about them. After receiving his Doctorate in nature science, Piaget’s interest in the nature of thought itself, or psychoanalysis, burgeoned, and it led him to France to work for a boys’ school. During that time, he noticed that children of the same age seemed to make the same mistakes on tests; this inflamed his interest in how the minds of children work and develop. Piaget’s subsequent research enabled him to develop the theory of cognitive development. <mark>It posits that there are actually two aspects to this development: assimilation, or the process of coming to know, and accommodation, or the child’s reaction to situations when he acquires the ability to know.</mark> Under these two aspects are organized the several stages of development that Piaget observed in children.</p>
                        <p class="mb-3">2 The assimilation is one of adaptation: the child uses the environment to fit experiences within a pre‑existing cognitive structure. This is a set of reflexes that exist when the child is born. [A] An infant fed by its mother automatically uses <strong class="font-bold">the sucking reflex</strong> to obtain milk. However, if the mother gives the child a bottle instead of her breast, the baby will employ the same sucking reflex <strong class="font-bold">it</strong> used for the breast with the nipple of the bottle. Piaget divided the assimilation process into two periods, the sensorimotor and the preoperational. The sensorimotor occurs during infancy and has six sub‑stages. [B] The infant starts out with a very limited knowledge of the world, but its cognitive abilities continue to develop based on the interactions with other human beings and its experiences. [C] In succession, the infant can be observed to evince reflexes such as grasping movements; repetitive habits – certain frequent motions with the hands; greater coordination between vision and the grasping of objects; object permanence or the capacity to know that something exists in space and time; experimentation with external objects; and finally, the <strong class="font-bold">development of insight and creativity</strong>, which shows that the baby is ready to move on to the next step that takes place during the toddler years and early childhood. This is the preoperational stage: intellectual development is evidenced by the use of symbols and some language that reflect the existence of memory and imagination. [D]</p>
                        <p class="mb-3">3 A child undergoing the accommodation aspect of development passes through two periods – concrete operational and formal operational. In the former, which occurs during early adolescence, a child demonstrates the capacity to manipulate measurements and concrete objects. He can solve problems involving measurements and apply them to things in his environment. The child has an increased attention span and begins to understand abstract ideas such as puns and analogies. In the formal operational stage, he begins to think of what is possible rather than merely what is real. He develops a self‑consciousness and a preoccupation with the self. Finally, the child begins to question ideas, which he accepted without question as a child, and sometimes rebels, especially against his parents.</p>
                        <p class="mb-3">4 Some scholars have questioned the rigidity of Piaget’s stages. They indicate that development is not always smooth and some later stages occur at an earlier period in the child’s life and vice versa. Since then, psychologists have been formulating theories which, while accepting the fact that development comes in stages, <strong class="font-bold">veer</strong> toward a larger core knowledge at birth.</p>
                        <p class="mb-3">5 The Armenian literary tradition began early in the fifth century A.D. with religious tracts and histories of the Armenians. The most important of these were written by Agathangelos, Egishe, Movses Khorenatsi, and Pavstos Buzand. A <strong class="font-bold">secular</strong> literature developed in the early modern period, and in the eighteenth century Armenian Catholic monks of the Mekhitarist order began publishing ancient texts, modern histories, grammars, and literature. In the nineteenth century, Armenians developed their own journalism and public theater. Khachatur Abovian wrote the first Armenian novel, Verk Haiastani (The Wounds of Armenia), in the early 1840s. Armenian literature and drama often <strong class="font-bold">depict</strong> struggles against religious and ethnic oppression and the aspirations of Armenians for security and selfexpression.</p>
